# Stakeholder Survey

## Background

As a first step of the stakeholder research a survey was conducted to better understand the current landscape, primary users, their aspirations and challenges faced along the way. This information also played an important role in planning for the upcoming engagements with the key stakeholders.

## Summary

### Findings

`#1` : **How can we effectively understand the impact of child poverty on education within urban and rural contexts?**

> **Helping School Professionals**
- Making them of the full range of data available.
- Help select which data is relevant to their priorities and which is not. 
- Services and Interventions available, not available and why.

> **Holistic Approach**
- Tracking a young person's school journey in its totality.
- Comsidering community, family and child together.
- Consulting with children and parents regarding the impact of poverty. 
- Engaging with families that are recipients of benefits.
- Generational issues and views of the children classed as in poverty. 
- Creating greater awareness of patterns among stakeholders including parents, carers and learners' representatives.

> **Defining Poverty**
- Difficult to track, there is a lot of hidden poverty.
- Reconsider the criteria for identifying child poverty. 
- Understanding all aspects of poverty across the child's day, week and year.
- Taking a broad view of poverty beyond finance, relating to quality of life.

> **Use of Information**
- Wider factors to consider than just SIMD and FSM. 
- Rural and Remote Rural contexts SIMD is a crude data measure.
- Having a wider view on data used to understand the local context.
- Developing systems to support authority-level and cluster-level analysis of patterns.

> **Others**
- Challenges around privacy and security; might be probing into personal life of individuals.
