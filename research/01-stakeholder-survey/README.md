# Stakeholder Survey

## Background

As a first step of the stakeholder research a survey was conducted to better understand the current landscape, primary users, their aspirations and challenges faced along the way. This information also played an important role in planning for the upcoming engagements with the key stakeholders.

### Stakeholder Inputs

`#1` : **How can we effectively understand the impact of child poverty on education within urban and rural contexts?**

> **Helping School Professionals**
- Making them of the full range of data available.
- Help select which data is relevant to their priorities and which is not. 
- Services and Interventions available, not available and why.

> **Holistic Approach**
- Tracking a young person's school journey in its totality.
- Comsidering community, family and child together.
- Consulting with children and parents regarding the impact of poverty. 
- Engaging with families that are recipients of benefits.
- Generational issues and views of the children classed as in poverty. 
- Creating greater awareness of patterns among stakeholders including parents, carers and learners' representatives.

> **Defining Poverty**
- Difficult to track, there is a lot of hidden poverty.
- Reconsider the criteria for identifying child poverty. 
- Understanding all aspects of poverty across the child's day, week and year.
- Taking a broad view of poverty beyond finance, relating to quality of life.

> **Use of Information**
- Wider factors to consider than just SIMD and FSM. 
- Rural and Remote Rural contexts SIMD is a crude data measure.
- Having a wider view on data used to understand the local context.
- Developing systems to support authority-level and cluster-level analysis of patterns.

> **Others**
- Challenges around privacy and security; might be probing into personal life of individuals.
- Cost of living in small communities; equity of opportuntiy of access to services etc.
- Using local level information on the context and demographics.
- Drilling down along with attainment data in the school - looking for trends.

`#2` - **What changes in the data and/or information ecosystem would have a positive impact in the education system?**

> **Central Access**
- Ease of access to data that allows key stakeholders with ability to engage with the data.
- One stop shop to gather and input data for the children from disadvantaged backgrounds.
- Fully integrated platforms which easily link attainment data to socio-economic data.
- Holistic view over time of what being successful looks like.
- Data systems whereby Health, Police, Social Work and Education professionals can have access to actionable data timely.

> **Consistency**
- Consitentcy of approach for LAs to see similar datasets / platforms to access from a National level.
- A coherent approach which is universally adopted across Local Authorities than each Authority making their own dashboards.

> **Types of Data**
- More detailed information on demographics in local areas.
- Timely availablity of data available from sources like SQA.
- Longitudinal data that measure value added and impact over years rather than focusing on attainment at points in time. 
- Enable efficient gathering and analysis of data so that school leaders and communities can respond more quickly and with greater intelligence. 

> **Others**
- Higher levels of awareness about the impact of poverty.
- Free up schools to work on creative solutions.
- Too much time is being wasted on needless administrative tasks 
- Ease up efforty by creating a better designed system.

`#3` - **How could any data and/or information available on the open education-based data platform we are developing be made more actionable for you?**

> **Features Required**
- Quickly determine trends across my establishment and compare that with others.
- Ability to filter by a wide range of headings and to be able to intersect different data.
- Benchmarking / comparison data to compare against other LAs / RIC.
- Metrics that can measure the effects of multiple factors - and extent to which one factor correlates with another.

> **Culture**
- Promote networking and sharing of practice amongst Local Authorities and Services.
- SIMD is not a universally reliable indicator of lack of advantage.
- The process of providing available data in turn could engage all education stakeholders.
- Include stakeholders in the expectation of their role to support and make support more inclusive.

> **Others**
- Clear data with clear pathways of action.
- Risk of disconnected and redundant data.
- More information about the local area.
