## Project Narrative

NORAL Project aims to determine what data sources and techniques can best reflect the challenges of child poverty, and subsequently provide means to assess poverty related attainment gaps. This will assist all the stakeholder involved with school, local authorities and other stakeholders to plant targeted interventions and take corrective action.

The objective within this initial phase is to work with stakeholders to identify the shared knowledge gap across local authorities, identify the most appropriate indicators and map the suitable data sources that can be used at the school catchment aggregation.

This phase involves actively interacting and engaging stakeholders in various research activities. Identifying their pain areas, challenges, aspirations, behaviours, patterns which can lead the research to define the direction of the project in larger scope.

## Stakeholder Research

Research plays a very integral part for any kind of platform building. Stakeholder Research findings lay a strong foundation for any kind of design decisions that we take in the course of the project. Multiple stakeholder research frameworks have backed these findings which will explore in this document

### Objective

The main objective of User /stakeholder research is to explore the unknown and unlock new possibilities. The core objective of conducting Research is to develop detailed insights and user requirements. This research will help to identify existing practices of stakeholders with data and point to their key challenge areas.

### What is a Stakeholder Research / Stakeholder Engagement

Stakeholders are people or organisations who have an interest in your research project, or affect or are affected by its outcomes. Stakeholders include those who are both supportive of your research, as well as those who may be less supportive or indeed critical of it.

Stakeholders can be prioritized as primary and secondary stakeholders.Primary stakeholder are those that stand to be directly affected, either positively or negatively, by the project, decisions, or actions of the project. Secondary stakeholders are those that are indirectly affected by the project, or decision, or actions of the project.

Stakeholder Insights have a massive influence in the way the project will shape further. By considering and mapping your different stakeholders according to their level of influence and interest you can plan how you will manage and prioritize your engagement with them.

The purpose of stakeholder analysis is to:

1.  Identify project stakeholders
2.  Determine what interest each stakeholder has in your project
3.  Assess how much influence stakeholders have on the project
4.  Consider how you will manage and communicate with different types of stakeholders.

Engaging with the right Stakeholder will provide a good amount of qualitative and quantitative information.

Primary Stakeholders identified for this project are as below:

#### Attainment Advisors
Attainment advisors are members of staff from Education Scotland – a branch of the Scottish Government. They have a specific role within the Scottish Attainment Challenge and work with schools who are enrolled within this programme. That is, schools who have a high roll of pupils living in Scotland’s most deprived programmes. Advisors work with these schools to review data and provide additionality in the form of interventions and come from a variety of backgrounds. They also take part in local authority developments as required.

#### Educational Psychologists
This group of professionals’ works across the authority and contributes to strategic areas, but there is a considerable focus on additional support for learning. They undertake work directly with children, young people and families around additional support needs and will consult and advise schools on how they can meet these needs. The means in which educational psychologists can contribute to schools meeting the needs of children and young people can be done targeted, at an individual or group level. Or systemically – at a whole school level or indeed a local authority level.

####  School Leaders
Head teachers and deputy head teachers are responsible for the overall operations of the school, including the health, safety and educational attainment of children and young people. They manage staff and will often lead professional learning activities in accordance with the school improvement plan and priorities which schools are required to complete. Leaders will use data and consult with the community, including partners, to construct the school improvement plan.

#### Quality Improvement Managers – Quality Improvement Officers – Education Support Officers
Individuals within the quality improvement team are based centrally and will work on authority-wide strategic areas, such as literacy development, health & wellbeing, early years etc. Colleagues, specifically quality improvement officers, may also be attached to specific associated school groups. They might support these specific schools by reviewing their attainment data and undertaking internal quality improvement visits.

## 1. Stakeholder Research Formats

Research involves exploring various formats to engage stakeholders. These are the typical formats explored in this project to generate Stakeholder study and to derive at critical insights around data or data sets used by stakeholders:  

### 1.1. Stakeholder Survey

As a first step of the stakeholder research a survey was conducted to better understand the current landscape, primary users, their aspirations and challenges faced along the way. This information also played an important role in planning for the upcoming engagements with the key stakeholders.

**Key Points**:
-   Individual Demographics
-   Data and platforms accessed
-   Stakeholder Inputs – Rural and Urban context
-   Data inputs – change / actionable / benefit

**Action**  – Designed a short survey to understand What kind of information/data you seek/prefer to know about your child's education in their region. The findings of this would help us design a more well-informed open education-based data platform truly by the people and for the people.

You can find Stakeholder questionnaire design [here](01-stakeholder-survey/01-01-stakeholder-survey.md).

**Result** - Stakeholder responses for the questionnaire can be found [here](01-stakeholder-survey/README.md),

### 1.2.  Stakeholder Workshops

The objective of the Stakeholder workshop was to collect insights from the stakeholder to build the following levels of information:

-   Possible Usage by end users of the platform
-   Information Layers required on the platform
-   Depth and Breadth of information on the platform

Key Points
-   Roles and Responsibilities in the system
-   Existing resources review
-   Suggested key feature feedback
-   Additional comments

**Action** – Conducted a workshop with all the active stakeholders engaging the education sector ecosystem of the Northern Alliance region of Scotland.

Information on the following fronts from key stakeholders:
-   Resources and Tools engaged with and their experiences
-   Feasibility and Impact for possibly shortlisted feature set
-   Key Experiences and Feedback interacting with related resources

You can find Stakeholder workshop design template [here](02-stakeholder-workshop/02-02-template.pdf).

**Result of Action** – Affinity Map for workshop Insights.

**What is Affinity Mapping?**
Affinity mapping is a great method to help you make sense of all your information when you have a lot of mixed data, such as facts, ethnographic research ideas from brainstorms, user opinions, user needs, insights, and design issues. Affinity mapping or clustering exercises are all about bundling and grouping information, and this method can be one of the most valuable methods to employ.

**Why Affinity Mapping?**
The Affinity Diagram is a method which can help you gather large amounts of data and organize them into groups or themes based on their relationships. The affinity process is great for grouping data gathered during research or ideas generated during Brainstorms.

**The Takeaway**
Affinity Diagrams can help you bundle and cluster large bodies of information, facts, ethnographic research, ideas from brainstorms, user opinions, user needs, insights, design issues, etc. This method will help you name, rank and understand relations between groups of information. For this reason, this method is also known as “Space Saturate and Group”. The term “saturate” relates to the method in which everyone covers or saturates the “space” with images and notes, in order to create a wall of information, to inform, and start “grouping” the following problem-defining process. This is a great method which can, if you follow the step-by-step process which we’ve described, surprisingly and straightforwardly create an overview and synthesize your findings. It’s important that you remember to sum up the major insights, user needs, pain points, gaps, etc.

### 1.3. Stakeholder Interviews

The main objective of Individual Stakeholder Interviews is to understand the role of access to information in solving poverty and attainment related gaps across the Northern Alliance Region of Scotland. These interviews focused on details related to individual stakeholder role & responsibilities, Stakeholder interaction with data or data sets, Challenges faced in the current system or data sets, Aspiration of the new platform and what all it should cover.

Information on the following fronts from key stakeholders:
-   Resources and Tools engaged with and their experiences
-   Feasibility and Impact for possibly shortlisted feature set
-   Key Experiences and Feedback interacting with related resources

**Key points**
-   Role of the stakeholder (What is the stakeholder accountable for in the ecosystem)
-   What does a working day look like for the stakeholder? (What all activity he /she conducts or is involved in)
-   What kind of data sets does the stakeholder interact with? (Names and description of data sets)
-   How is that data beneficial for the stakeholder? (What purpose does the data solve and how does the stakeholder take corrective action based on it)
-   What all challenges are faced by the stakeholder with respect to the ecosystem, frameworks or data?
-   Dream and aspiration with respect to data and ecosystem (Expectations)

**Action**  – Conducted individual interviews with a variety of stakeholder involved in the ecosystem

Interview template access can be found [here](https://github.com/The-Data-for-Children-Collaborative/noral-user-research/blob/main/03-stakeholder-interviews/interview-script.md).

**Result of Action**– Stakeholder Insight Map

**What is a Stakeholder Insight Map?**
Stakeholder Insight mapping gives an overview of all the points or insights that individual stakeholders have mentioned in their individual interviews. It is aligned to the script of the interview questions. Stakeholder groups are made based on their common roles to map the insights.

**Why Stakeholder Insight mapping?**
Stakeholder mapping will provide a common points or insights under stakeholder roles and will highlight their key challenges and aspirations

**The Takeaway**
Stakeholder mapping provides a head start to develop persons for stakeholders involved in the project. It highlights roles and responsibilities of stakeholders, existing platform usage, challenges and aspirations.

## 2. Research Consolidation

Translation of summarised data generated from each research step to formulate a single constructive research outcome for building the data platform is referred to as Research Consolidation. Findings from research need a strong consolidation framework to support the outcomes. A suitable consolidation framework was developed for the data generated from the research done through Surveys, Workshops and Stakeholder Interviews

Below is the overview of Data available from each research step.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/5ND8jlYsnERXv27ilBTk7WlvvTPuFFRHOvfQOYFBZgYz5Miy5qyNNekAw2Qh1BvhOUg9sXmDx58M80FVAiSkTUOWosdw_56dqNuzu-5fOBG4VfThkDws91MYZqcUfg=s0)

Based on the the above data following are the steps generated for research consolidation.

### 2.1. Stakeholder Interviews

Data generated from Stakeholder Interviews spoke more about the individual people roles and responsibilities along with their challenges and aspirations

The data gathered from stakeholder interviews needs a structure to cluster inputs and insights to form a set of target primary and secondary stakeholder requirements . This is supported by generating User personas for each of the stakeholders.

Creating personas will help to understand users' needs, experiences, behaviours and goals. It can help to recognise that different people have different needs and expectations, and it can also help to identify with the user you're designing for.

Personas can be supported with Stakeholder Insight Map generated from Stakeholder Interviews.

**Pre - work**:
-   Synthesizing information /insights from the stakeholder interview
-   Develop areas of conversation/categories
-   Identify Patterns
-   List of Pain areas/points
-   Look for overlaps or unusual insights

**2.1.1. Stakeholder persona Framework**

-   **Name**: Could be realistic, could be taken from an actual customer, or it could be a descriptive handle like “Sally the Thrift-shopper.”
-   **Job Responsibilities**: Provide details related to roles and responsibilities.
-   **Photo**: It always helps to put a face to a name. Stock photos are fine, but avoid photos of celebrities, co-workers or other familiar faces that may come with built-in connotations and assumptions. The idea is creating a new, original identity.
-   **Personal Quote / Motto**: Just like a photo, this helps flesh out the persona to make them seem more real.
-   **Bio**: Give a little backstory to make the person relatable. What was their childhood like? Why did they choose their current job? How do they spend their free time? These tiny details could influence strategic choices down the road.
-   **Demographics**: Age, sex, income, location—whatever attributes are relevant to your industry. Job title is particularly important, considering its business and financial implications.
-   Personality Traits/Self initiatives/: People with low attention spans want faster site designs. Cautious people are most likely to compare shops. Personality traits are one of the most useful features of personas, so choose these with care.
-   **Motivations** (Specifically to what data is for them): Like personality traits, this helps you get inside the customer’s head and understand how they think. For example, would a customer be more likely to buy a product that improves their career or their personal life? It depends on which motivates them more.
-   **Frustrations / Challenges**: The scope of these is in direct relation to your needs. A lifestyle company would keep to general life and career goals, while a tech company could hone in on more specific goals like tasks they hope to accomplish with their software.
-   **Preferred Platforms**: You can tell a lot about a person based on which brands they like and what kind of people influence their decisions. You can also look at those brands’ marketing strategies to see if their tactics might apply to you as well.
·  **Goals**: Dream Ecosystem or Dream platform to help them take data driven decisions

Keep in mind that personas are wholly customizable, and the above list is just a starting point. Here are some additional areas that some companies find useful when building out a persona:
-   Preferred social media channels
-   Daily routine
-   Tech skill
-   Personality types
-   Hobbies and interests
-   Education level
-   Shopping and product research habits

Personas should be customized to your specific needs, so it’s better to create your own original personas than to use ones designed for other companies.

### 2.2. Stakeholder Surveys and Workshops

Data generated from Stakeholder Surveys and Workshops primarily addressed Stakeholder preferences in terms of platform use and feature feedback.

Preferences needed a prioritization framework to develop the user journeys for each stakeholder.

Following is the applicable prioritization framework used.

**2.2.1. MosCoW Prioritization Framework**  

**What is MosCoW Prioritization Framework?**

MoSCoW prioritization, also known as the MoSCoW method or MoSCoW analysis, is a popular prioritization technique for managing requirements. The method is commonly used to help key stakeholders understand the significance of initiatives in a specific release.

MoSCoW stands for four different categories of initiatives: must-haves, should-haves, could-haves, and will not have. Sometimes, the “W” in MoSCoW is used to stand for “wish” instead of “will not have right now.”

**Why MosCoW Prioritization Framework?**

MoSCoW prioritization, will help in feature prioritization for the platform. Features can be prioritized for each stakeholder based on their requirements and needs. This prioritization will be developed based on the qualitative comments /resources received from the interviews and workshops.

**2.2.2. User Journey Maps**

Based on the Stakeholder Prioritization Framework and Personas we developed the user journeys maps for each stakeholder.

**What is a User Journey Map?**
A user journey map (also known as a customer journey map) is a diagram that visually illustrates the user flow through your platform, starting with initial contact or discovery, and continuing through the process of engagement into long-term loyalty and advocacy.

**Advantages**
The process of mapping their journey encourages and reminds them to consider the entire user experience: their feelings, questions and needs while they interact with the platform. It’s used for understanding and addressing customer needs and pain points. What is the user thinking about and what are they hoping to achieve?

Outcomes of User Personas and their respective User Journey maps can be found below:

1.  [Quality Improvement Managers](personas-and-journeys/pdf/quality-improvement-managers.pdf)
2.  [Attainment Advisors](personas-and-journeys/pdf/attainment-dvisors.pdf)
3.  [Education Psychologists](personas-and-journeys/pdf/educational-psychologist.pdf)
4.  [Head Teachers](personas-and-journeys/pdf/head-teachers.pdf)

**Conclusion**

Stakeholder analysis uncovers and removes multiple barriers in understanding the project's progression, stakeholder analysis. It also eliminates the roadblocks in releasing successful projects by getting information about project supporters, opponents, and their levels of importance in the project.

By using the consolidation methods of personas and user journeys we plan to achieve the following steps ahead:

1.  User journeys will help in further building wireframes of each stakeholder for the platform
2.  It will address the needs and aspiration along with user action which the platform can cover
3.  It will also scope the space of opportunities that can be achieved as per user needs
