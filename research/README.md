# Stakeholder Research
> NORAL Project - **Action, Output & Impact**

## Project Narrative

NORAL Project aims to determine what data sources and techniques can best reflect the challenges of child poverty, and subsequently provide means to assess poverty related attainment gaps. This will assist all the stakeholder involved with school, local authorities and other stakeholders to plant targeted interventions and take corrective action.

The objective of the initial phase involves actively interacting and engaging stakeholders in various research activities. Identifying their pain aereas, challenges, aspirations , behaviours , patterns which can lead the research to define the direction of the project in larger scope.

The main objective of user / stakeholder research for this project is to explore the unknown and unlock new possibilities. The core objective of conducting Research is to develop detailed insights and user requirements. This research will help to identify existing practices of stakeholders with data and point to their key challenge areas.

Primary Stakeholders Identified for this project are as below:
-   Attainment Advisors
-   Educational Psychologists
-   School Leaders
-   Quality Improvement Managers / Quality Improvement Officers / Education Support Officers

## Research Framework Used for Stakeholder Inputs:

### > Stakeholder Survey

Designed a short survey to understand What kind of information/data you seek/prefer to know about your child's education in their region taking into account following points:

- Individual Demographics
- Data and Platforms accessed
- Stakeholder Inputs – Rural and Urban context
- Data Inputs – change / actionable / benefit

[Survey outputs can be found here.](01-stakeholder-survey/README.md)

### > Stakeholder Workshop    

Conducted Stakeholder workshops to engage stakeholders with proposed feature feedback taking into account following points:

- Roles and Responsibilities of the system
- Existing resources review
- Suggested Key Features
- Additional Comments

[Workshop outputs can be found here.](02-stakeholder-workshop/README.md)

### > Stakeholder Interviews
    
Conducted individual stakeholder interviews with primary and secondary stakeholders taking into account following points:

- Role of the stakeholder (What is the stakeholder accountable for in the ecosystem)
- What does a working day look like for the stakeholder? (What all activity he /she conducts or is involved in)
- What kind of data sets does the stakeholder interact with? (Names and description of data sets)
- How is that data beneficial for the stakeholder? (What purpose does the data solve and how does the stakeholder take corrective action based on it)
- What all challenges are faced by the stakeholder with respect to the ecosystem, frameworks or data?
- Dream and aspiration with respect to data and ecosystem (Expectations)

[Interview outputs can be found here.](https://github.com/The-Data-for-Children-Collaborative/noral-user-research/blob/main/research/03-stakeholder-interviews/README.md)

## Consolidation Framework
>  Framework used for developing Stakeholder Inputs

Below is the overview of information available from each research step.

Based on the the above data following are the steps generated for research consolidation:

**Consolidation for Stakeholder Interviews**

Data generated from Stakeholder Interviews spoke more about the individual people roles and responsibilities along with their challenges and aspirations.

1.  Generating **User Personas** methodology was used to support Stakeholder Insights from Stakeholder Interviews.
2.  **User Journeys Maps** based on the Stakeholder Prioritization Framework and Personas we developed the user journeys maps for each stakeholder.

**Outcomes of User Personas and their respective User Journey maps can be found below:** 

1.  [Quality Improvement Managers](personas-and-journeys/pdf/quality-improvement-managers.png)
2.  [Attainment Advisors](personas-and-journeys/pdf/attainment-dvisors.png)
3.  [Education Psychologists](personas-and-journeys/pdf/educational-psychologist.png)
4.  [Head Teachers](personas-and-journeys/pdf/head-teachers.png)

## Conclusion

Stakeholder analysis uncovers and removes multiple barriers in understanding the project's progression, stakeholder analysis. It also eliminates the roadblocks in releasing successful projects by getting information about project supporters, opponents, and their levels of importance in the project.

By using the consolidation methods of personas and user journeys we plan to achieve the following steps ahead:
1.  User journeys will help in further building wireframes of each stakeholder for the platform
2.  It will address the needs and aspiration along with user action which the platform can cover
3.  It will also scope the space of opportunities that can be achieved as per user needs
