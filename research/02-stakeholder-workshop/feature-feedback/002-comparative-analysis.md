# Comparative Analysis
Ability to compare areas, schools, authorities on availability of resources (financing, facilities, etc.) and outcomes of the education system (attainment. etc.)

## Impact
- Different systems have different strengths and weaknesses.
- NIF is good for comparing local authorities/ Scotland wide.
- Insight is good for comparing school level information.
- Allows you to see how others have achieved things that you haven't
- Impact of comparative stuff has been limited, has not affected actions of the school admin.
- Don't use tools like BGE Toolkit very much, forget that the tools are available.
- Very important component before starting any initiative.

## Actionability
- Need context with the data, comparator doesn't tell you what you need to do for your schools.
- Not clear on how to make the information available more actionable.
- The main issue is what we actually compare. How robust and reliable e.g. is ACEL data?

## Frequency 
- Anything created to compare was outdated as soon as it was published, the information needs to be more live.
- Relevance goes away quickly - people stop using; Importance of using varies by time of year.

## Capacity 
- Huge investment of time and resources for teachers, don't have the luxury of looking at other schools.
- If you know how to access this and have the time then it is very helpful.

## Requirements 
- Crucial to allow comparisons to be made with similar organisation both within and across LAs.
- Allowing schools to choose their own compartors rather than a pre-assigned set.
- Ability to compare attainment and progress, stories behind the attainment.
- A system should allow for intelligent accountability around data as opposed to judgements by headline figures.
- Strengths analysis rather than a comparitive analysis.
- Measures are really important here - commonalities and not comparing apples with pears.
- Financing and facilities are what they are, not enough influence; wouldn't want to compare financing etc.

## Challnenges
- Need to be very careful so that the data isn't used in a league table type way.
- Prevent comparison and spark curiosity then it is helpful to creat accountability.
- Stuck with a single database, more meaningful data required when so many small schools.

## Data
- Challenges with data sharing agreements/protocols and legislative restrictions.
- Currently disempowered by data - need to be able to connect with it much better and own it.
- How to multiply up your data for low strength schools, to make data for such regions more reliable.

## Collaboration
- No responses from other schools to learn practices, it will be important to learn from that.
- Gives an opportunity to have a conversation the Local Authority, about what is being offered from one Local Authority to another.
- Unsure how often schools are accessing national data or wider LA data as part of comparative data and understanding their narrative.
