# Data Stories
Ability to showcase specific analyses, reports, stories, etc. for various use cases with the methodology and the data made accesible for further research.

## Use Cases
- Schools knows the local context, data for backing that up is limited; marginal gains are important.
- Difficult to get the complete picture of the story, understanding the realities behind the data.
- Trying tocapture the hollistic picture of the child rather than the end data point; qualitative Data becomes more important in some use cases.
- Data stories around children who are on the margins and build packages to properly look at where there stand
- Case studies, especially in pandemic times so you can understand what is going on.
- Schools tend to start with soft data and then look at data sources to justify the findings.
- Schools developing an enquire stance, to change the culture to the child from the data.

## Challenges 
- Too much data can be overwhelming - Data paralysis / overload for stakeholders.
- You can make data tell any story, school can tell anystory but difficult for inspectors to verify.

## Data
- Data collection doesn't match the relality; discrepancies in the information collected. Difficult to create a plan of action.
- Not sure how accurate the schools are in terms of collecting the data, need a bottom up model for data.

## Purpose
- Telling stories from data should be everyones responsibility; where work is happening and where it's not across authorities and Scotland
- Identifying the purpose and telling your own story. Putting weight on beingable to tell these stories -for elected members etc.
- There is also a limit to how many meaningful stories can be generated!

## Schools
- Data dives always comes down to learning and teaching, school to create a bespoke packages.
- Our schools put together to support wellbeing and intervention impact measurement; thinking SAC impact as example.

## Impact
- Would like a data stories engine; The Model for Improvement allows us to tell the story but also enables us to measure impact.
- Data stories are important in order to better capture the context and to allow for moremenaingful analysis.

## Bias
- Practioners who feel challenging children are somebody else's problem.
- Inclusivity challenge, behaviour bias towards children from certain backgrounds.

## Currently
- We are starting to use Pentana system because it allows us to add the narrative behind the numbers.
- SEEMiS does not allow you to do this - but it should provide that capability.
- Fairly easy to do as data was in place for some use cases, in other it was difficult to collect and understand.
