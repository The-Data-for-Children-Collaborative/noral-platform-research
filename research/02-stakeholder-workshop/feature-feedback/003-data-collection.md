# Data Collection
Mechanism to collect and store data from numerous on-ground collection methodologies in a central location linked to various other information about the area.

## Data
- Putting all the data together across levels would be useful to capture trends.
- Microsoft forms to family, children etc., Move the data collected to more interactive sources.
- Attendance data might be required on daily basis to annual attainment data. 
- Future destinations of leavers information, especially where they stay in their community.
- Robustness, moderation and validity of the data, if you have too much you will stop using it.

## Challenges
- Trying to create a system to collect data is a challenge, trying to get information; had to email relevant stakeholders.
- Data collection can be done in a very inefficient way e.g. paper based systems; need a system that removes inefficiency and enables interrogation.
- Data collection is one element - however, analysis and annotation is essential to drill down for intervention.
- Challenges in how to analyse the data, how to use information sitting in the source.
- How do we capture and access certain information; difficult to compare with other local schools.
- Depends on how important is it for me to use that data, working with focus schools is priotrities.

## Type
- Collecting data on multiple factors like behaviourial data.
- Mainly text based data collection than numerical; formative, qualitative data which is important. 

## Current System
- Huge wealth of data, but no standardization of availability and use.
- Lot of double entry of data going on, not getting accurate information.
- Some systems of data collection too simple when complex data needs to be collected.
- Systems don't align directly, high chance of data breach or incorrect data being collected.

## Capacity 
- Extremely time consuming process, not enough understanding for sources and information.
- Appropriate training needs to be put in place for whatever system develops.
- Wouldn't want to swamp a schooll, this is more about capacity perhaps and inidvidual skills.

## Requirements
- A single system would be transformative then there would be no need for multiple inputs, however recognise the difficulties around creating it.
- Needs ability to gather meaningful data; focus on region specific data that will be helpful.
- Type of data that's available is important and timescales to be used in is critical; level dependent, to acctually collect and use data.
