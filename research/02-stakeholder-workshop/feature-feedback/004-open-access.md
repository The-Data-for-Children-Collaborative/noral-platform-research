# Open Access
Creating an open data platform where all public interest information is available to key stakeholders and citizens to better engage with their community.

## Impact
- Open information is just as good as information closed; open access would improve relationship with schools.
- Freedom of Information, public need to know what we're doing; Research, OECD reports, etc. will be useful, conclusions drawn from open access data is very helpful sometimes.
- There are datasets that are open and you want people to be aware of it; would also reduce the need for sharing.

## Resistance 
- When data becomes public, it has impact on schools, community, people in England move to areas looking at data as league tables.
- Without background understanding the data can be misused; Would be very vary to make it open access, okay with things being hard to find.
- Need more trust in interpreting such information; there is a risk of SG, citizens, media using data league tables, etc to make judgements.
- Targetting of communities with a brush; Not looking at only one small aspect of a school's work.

## Access
- Huge amount of data not shared, data not submitted to systems sometimes to appear as open information.
- Don't use a lot of open information, wouldn't describe the acess to this information as easy.
- Lack of information gives a skewed picture, cohorts data is not useful at all.
- Data for small schools not reliable, virtual comparator only useful if you are a school of a certain size.

## Tools
- Visual usability is variable across systems, data in spreadsheet isn't accessible, visualising stuff is much better for sharing.
- Power BI is great and can pull info together in a very visual way, Tableau Dashboards are available, other systems not as good.

## Parents
- Parents have login into secure area where they can see their own child's info and challenges in the region.
- If you could see tracking over time as a parent e.g. notes of concern, missing assignments that would be excellent.
- Parents from smallers chools not able to make use of data targetted at them; eg. chools affect house pricing and other factors.

## Ideas
- Different views for different users with same underlying data, be careful what data is available.
- Tension between the need for information and the confidentiality surrounding such data.
- Ideal system would be a dashboard presented in an appropriate way for different people accessing them.
- System does not reflect the complexity of the data collected, need to showcase that better.

## Capacity
- Need to be mindful of data overload, can be so much out there and ensuring it is targeted/accessed for need (clarity of purpose again).
- If sharing widely we would need to help those who access it to understand/interpret it, you can be accountable about open access.

## Granularity
- School level data shouldn't be made open, community, local authority level is useful.
- Fine balance of important general information and not specific data on schools.

## Others
- Within NA hoping that culture and trust will allow sharing.
- It is about knowing what is available and how/where to access it.
- Child poverty action report, any data around poverty.
