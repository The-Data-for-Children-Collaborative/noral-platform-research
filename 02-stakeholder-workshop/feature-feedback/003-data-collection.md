# Data Collection
Mechanism to collect and store data from numerous on-ground collection methodologies in a central location linked to various other information about the area.

## Data

 - Move the data collected to more interactive sources
 - Microsoft forms to family, children etc.
 - Future destinations of leavers - esp where they stay in their community
 - Robustness, moderation and validity of the data
 - Putting all the data together across levels would be useful to capture trends
 - Attendance data might be required on daily basis to annual attainment data
 - Needs to be valid data, if you have too much you will stop using it

## Challenges

 - Trying to create a system to collect data is a challenge
 - Data collection can be done in a very inefficient way e.g. paper based systems
 -  We need a systemt that removes inefficiency and enables interrogation
 - Not easy at all, trying to get information; had to email attainmnet advisors
 - How to use information sitting in the source
 - Challenges in how to analyse the data
 - Data collection is one element - however, analysis and annotation is essential to drill down for intervention
 - How do we capture and access certain information
 - Accessibility - E.g. lots of people struggle to get into the tools like Insight - Bandwith etc.
 - Acceptability
 - Difficult to compare with other local schools
 - Depends on how important is it for me to use that data
 - Working with focus schools is priotrities

## Type

 - Collecting data on multiple factors like behaviourial data
 - Mainly text based data collection than numerical
 - Formative, qualitative data which is important

## Current System

 - Huge wealth of data, but no standardization of availability and use
 - Lot of double entry of data going on, not getting accurate information
 - Some systems of data collection too simple when complex data needs to be collected
 - Some authorities have authority wide tracking system
 - Much better systems available now that relying on excel spreadsheets - need to be more efficient
 - Systems don't align directly which means - There's a high chance of data breach or incorrect data being collected

## Capacity 

 - Appropriate training needs to be put in place for whatever system develops
 - Wouldn't want to swamp a school
 - This is more about capacity perhaps and inidvidual skills
 - Extremely time consuming process, not enough understanding for sources and information

## Requirements

 - A single system would be transformative - However recognise the difficulties around creating it
 - Focus on region specific data that will be helpful
 - Needs ability to gather meaningful data - Especially with ASN this is bolted onat the end rather than the system being designed around it
 - One system would be great because then there would be no need for multiple inputs
 - Level dependent, to acctually collect and use data
 - Type of data that's available is important and timescales to be used in is critical
