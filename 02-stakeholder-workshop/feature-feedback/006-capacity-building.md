# Capacity Building
Enabling key stakeholders and community at large to better adopt / use the tool and technologies, through various resources embedded into the platform.

## Culture

 - The culture ofmoving beyond minimum level
 - Everbody realising data is important, realising how data can help
 - The benchmarks have created cielings
 - Changing the culture of data
 - Huge potential to change the culture but too much data.
 - Exceeding the level model
 - Attitude around working with tools; Assigned data person in teams
 - Clear about the purpose of using data
 - Data should be everyone's responsibility
 - Centred on children and not other external factors
 - Priorities of different groups towards data and capacity building

## Capacity

 - Build teacher confidence in data analysing, collecting, etc
 - Frequency of use will determine how easy stakeholders find the interface
 - Training modules are lacking; just passing on information
 - Key role of leadership in driving forward what is best for every young child
 - Regular training and opportunities to apply skills would need to be provided/available
 - Lot of regular training is required
 - Stakeholders require training in interpretation of data
 - A coaching approach to upskilling stakeholders would be a good idea
 - Capacity building a huge societal task; depending on the context of the tool
 - Continually use a platform otherwise you forget it
 - Important to capacity build because it makes an impact on children's learning and next step. Teachers need to be data literate

## Existing Tools

 - SNSA not being used enough yet
 - Still need alot of work on how to best use SNSA
 - When SEEMiS was rolled out - Just told to use something - Without onboarding
 - Clunky first iterations turned a lot of people away
 - Using SNSA to do diagnostic of the problems
 - Power BI great for this, other systems vary

## Usage

 - Who are we aiming the solution towards
 - Take note of how this information is being taken down the levels
 - Very challenging middle of the pandemic
 - Data has to be fit for purpose and usage clear to stakeholders
 - Internet access
 - Need to go out to stakeholders to see what they're using -what will they engage with
 - Local circumstance need to be reflected - what data is important to a particular community

## Children

 - If you can get parents and children to engage in inputting data and using it then you have a true partnership
 - Children too - involving them in their learning is useful. What's being gathered about them and why
 - Other things have impacts on learners -achievements outside school - if child had opportunity to input this that would be good

## Other

 - Local health information that need to be shared a little bit lower?
 - Apps? Nudge technology?
 - Voluntary use vs must use
 - What we think is important vs what's important for families and children
 - Might there besome cases where the 'big messages' are extrapolated and disseminated
