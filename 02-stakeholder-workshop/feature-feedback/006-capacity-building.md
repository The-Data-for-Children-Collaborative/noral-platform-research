# Capacity Building
Enabling key stakeholders and community at large to better adopt / use the tool and technologies, through various resources embedded into the platform.

## Culture
- Changing the culture of data, everbody realising the importance, and how data it can help.
- The culture of moving beyond minimum level; the benchmarks have created cielings.
- Attitude around working with tools; Assigned data person in teams, data should be everyone's responsibility.
- Huge potential to change the culture but too much data; clarity about the purpose of using data.
- Priorities of different groups towards data and capacity building are different.
- Data usage should be centred on children and not other external factors.

## Capacity
- Lot of regular training is required to build teacher confidence in data analysing, collecting, etc.
- Training modules and guidance in interpretation of data are lacking; just passing on information.
- Key role of leadership in driving forward what is best for every young child.
- Capacity building a huge societal task; depending on the context of the tool.
- Regular training and opportunities to apply skills would need to be provided/available.
- Important to capacity build because it makes an impact on children's learning and next step. Teachers need to be data literate.

## Existing Tools
- Tools like SEEMiS were rolled out with instructions to use without proper onboarding process.
- SNSA not being used enough yet; Still need alot of work on how to best use SNSA, also to do diagnostic of the problems.
- Clunky first iterations turned a lot of people away; Power BI great for this, other systems vary.

## Usage
- Take note of how this information is being taken down the levels.
- Who are we aiming the solution towards; data has to be fit for purpose and usage clear to stakeholders.
- Very challenging with internet access, in the middle of the pandemic.
- Need to go out to stakeholders to see what they're using, what will they engage with.
- Local circumstance need to be reflected, what data is important to a particular community.

## Children
- If you can get parents and children to engage in inputting data and using it then you have a true partnership.
- Involving children in their learning is useful. What's being gathered about them and why.
- Other things have impacts on learners: achievements outside school, if child had opportunity to input this that would be good.

## Other
- Local health information that need to be shared a little bit lower.
- What we think is important vs what's important for families and children.
- Voluntary use vs must use: Apps? Nudge technology?
- Might there besome cases where the 'big messages' are extrapolated and disseminated.
