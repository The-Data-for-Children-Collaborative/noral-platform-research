# Open Access
Creating an open data platform where all public interest information is available to key stakeholders and citizens to better engage with their community.

## Impact

 - There are datasets that are open and you want people to be aware of it
 - Research, OECD reports, etc. will be useful
 - Would be useful as would reduce the need for sharing
 - Open information is just as good as information closed
 - Open access would improve relationship with schools
 - Freedom of Information, public need to know what we're doing
 - Conclusions that can be drawn from open access data is very helpful sometimes

## Resistance 

 - Okay with things being hard to find
 - When data becomes public, it has impact on schools, community
 - People in England move to areas looking at league tables
 - Would bevery vary to make it open access
 - Has to be trust - there is a risk of SG using it to do league tables etc
 - Targetting of communities with a brush
 - Area dependent responses to the ranking and ratings
 - Not looking at only one small aspect of a school's work, such information is not helpful and demoralising
 - Without background understanding the data can be misused
 - Also other actors (media etc) can use the data in unhelpful ways
 - People make judgement about schools based on tables and rankings
 - Outwith that -would question why it would be shared more widely

## Access

 - Lack of information gives a skewed picture
 - Data not submitted to systems sometimes to appear as open information
 - Huge amount of data not shared
 - Cohorts data is not useful at all
 - Data for small schools not reliable
 - Virtual comparator only useful if you are a school of a certain size
 - Don't use a lot of open information
 - Wouldn't describe the acess to this information as easy

## Tools

 - Power BI - can pull info together in a very visual way
 - Visual usability is variable across systems
 - Data in spreadsheet isn't accessible -visualising stuff is much better for sharing
 - Tableau Dashboards are available
 - Power BI dashboard is great
 - Other systems not as good

## Parents

 - Parents have login into secure area where they can see their own child's info
 - People want to live in village over town but need child care, higher price but school doesn't meet the needs
 - If you could see tracking over time as a parent e.g.notes of concern, missing assignments that would be excellent
 - Parents from smallers chools not able to make use, targetted at them
 - Schools affect house pricing and other factors

## Ideas

 - Tension between the need for information and the confidentiality surrounding such data
 - Different views for different users with same underlying data - but must be careful what data is available
 - Ideal system wouldbe dashboard presented inappropriate way for different people accessing them
 - System does not reflect the complexity of the data collected
 - Partial open data a good way to represent the information?

## Capacity

 - Need to be mindful of data overload - can be so much out there and ensuring it is targeted/accessed for need (clarity of purpose again)
 - If sharing widely we would need to help those who access it to understand/interpret it
 - You can be accountable about open access.

## Granularity 

 - School leveldata shouldn't be, community, local authority level is useful
 - Data specific about a school, or a community as a country
 - Fine balance of important general information and not specific data on schools

## Others

 - Certain helpful ones that we might want to look in it
 - Within NA hoping that culture and trust will allow sharing
 - It is about knowing what is available and how/where to access it
 - Child poverty action report, any data around poverty
