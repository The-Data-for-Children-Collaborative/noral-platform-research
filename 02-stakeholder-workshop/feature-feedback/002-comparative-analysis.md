# Comparative Analysis
Ability to compare areas, schools, authorities on availability of resources (financing, facilities, etc.) and outcomes of the education system (attainment. etc.)

## Impact

 - Has not affected actions of the school admin
 - Impact of comparative stuff has been limited
 - Very important component before starting an initiative
 - Don't use tools like BGE Toolkit very much
 - Forget that the tools are available
 - Similar issues with Insight Senior phase
 - BGE benchmarking - not used as much but can compares chools
 - Insight - good for comparing school level
 - Different systems have different strengths and weaknesses
 - NIF - good for comparing local authorities/ Scotland wide
 - Usefulness -allows you to see how others have achieved things that you haven't

## Actionability

 - The main issue is what we actually compare. How robust and reliable e.g. is ACEL data?
 - Need context with the data
 - Comparator doesn't tell you what you need to do for your schools
 - Not clear on how to make the information actionable

## Frequency 

 - Anything created to compare was outdated as soon as it was published
 - A system that could be here and now, compare attainment as soon as you can
 - Relevance goes away quickly - people stop using
 - Importance of using varies by time of year

## Capacity 

 - Don't have the luxury of looking at other schools
 - If you know how to access this and have the time then it is very helpful
 - Huge investment of time and resources for teachers

## Requirements 

 - Crucial to allow comparisons to be made with similar organisation both within and across LAs
 - Strength of moderation of e.g. CfE ACEL across Scotland and robust nature of data - also strength of SQA data for 2020 and 2021
 - Could schools choose their own compartors rather than being assigned them
 - Ability to compare attainment and progress is great
 - A system should allow for intelligent accountability around data as opposed to judgements by headline figures
 - Wouldn't want to compare financing etc.
 - Stories behind the attainment
 - Measures are really important here -commonalities and not comparing apples with pears
 - Strengths analysis rather than a comparitive analysis
 - Financing and facilities are what they are, not enough influence

## Challnenges

 - Not in terms of' league tables'. But in terms of curiosity then it is helpful. Helps with accountability
 - Stuck with a database, meaningful data required when so many small schools
 - Need to be very careful so that the data isn't used in a league table type way

## Data

 - Currently disempowered by data - need to be able to connect with it much better and own it
 - Data sharing agreements/protocols and legislative restrictions?
 - How do you multiply up your data for low strength schools
 - The nature of where welive to have reliable data

## Collaboration

 - Contacted schools but no response to learn practices
 - If there is great outcomes it will be important to learn from that
 - Gives you an opening to have a conversation from your own LA, about what is being offered from one LA to another
 - However I am unsure how often schools are accessing national data or wider LA data as part of comparative data and understanding their narrative
