# Data Stories
Ability to showcase specific analyses, reports, stories, etc. for various use cases with the methodology and the data made accesible for further research.

## Use Cases

 - Difficult to get the complete picture of the story
 - Schools knows the local context, data for backing that up is limited
 - Understanding the realities behind the data
 - Trying tocapture the hollistic picture rather than the end data point
 - Data stories around children who are on the margins and build packages to properly look at where there stand
 - Marginal gains are so important and I think sometimes we loose focus on this
 - How much information about a child the teachers need to create a hollistic view
 - Schools tend to start with soft data and then look at data sources to justify the findings
 - Case studies etc-especially in pandemic times so you can understand what is going on. Individual measures can be misleading.
 - Qualitative Data becomes more important in some use cases
 - Schools developing an enquire stance, to change the culture to the child from the data

## Challenges 

 - Too much data can be overwhelming - Data paralysis /overload
 - School can tell anystory but difficult for inspectors to verify
 - You can make data tell any story

## Data

 - Data collection doesn't match the relality; discrepancies in the information collected. Difficult to create a plan of action
 - Not sure how accurate the schools are in terms of collecting the data
 - Need a bottom up model for data

## Purpose

 - Telling stories from data should be everyones responsibility
 - Where work is happening and where it's not across authorities and scotland
 - Identifying the purpose and telling your own story
 - Putting weight on beingable to tell these stories -for elected members etc.
 - There is also a limit to how many meaningful stories we can generate!

## Schools

 - School to create a bespoke package
 - Data dives always comes down to learning and teaching
 - Our schools put together to support wellbeing and intervention impact measurement -thinking SAC impact as e.g.
 - Speaking to schools and finding out the reality

## Impact

 - The Model for Improvement allows us to tell the story but also enables us to measure impact
 - Would like a data stories engine
 - Data stories are important in order to better capture the context and to allow for moremenaingful analysis

## Bias

 - Practioners who feel challenging children are somebody else's problem
 - Inclusivity challenge
 - Behaviour bias towards children

## Currently

 - We are starting touse Pentana system because it allows us to add the narrative behind the numbers
 - Small places with small population it was difficult
 - Different view at an authority level
 - SEEMiS does not allow you to do this - but it should
 - Fairly easy to do as data was in place for some use cases
 - In other it was difficult to collect and understand
 - SIMD 5/10 point scale can give very different views
