# Information Mapping
Layering numerous sources of information in an area around education (child, teacher, parents, etc.) toservices available (healthcare, financing, justice, etc.) to better track the factors affecting the education of a child.

## Overall

 - Very important to update data on a regular basis
 - A single system which ensures relevant data is available to schools timeously
 - You need access for sure
 - No central point to get data from various sources
 - Arguably the most important feature
 - This is definitely essential for new system
 - Information mapping like this would be amazing - a one stop shop where all this information is readily availabe
 - Would be really helpful if there was a 'one stop shop' that all LA/colleagues could access this very quickly

## Access

 - Procuring required data is a difficult task
 - Also having to access various different links can be difficult
 - Legality of using the data
 - Access to certain daata required not shared
 - Workinging with anecdotal information
 - Generally we dont get access to the information needed
 - There are some great data sources - we just need to make it more accessible
 - Already have data sets in place and information sharing across our establishments - would be interface/sharing/data transition
 - Information sharing agreements and data transfer - particularly multi-agency?

## Privacy 

 - Security of huge amount of personal data
 - Extremely sensitive data about children
 - Personal acquantences in rural areas

## Geography 

 - Rural nature  - stuck with national data than local data
 - Small populations don't have enough data to look at
 - Affluent data areas doesn't match areas of depreievation
 - Geographic context are different across areas
 - A lot of information based around population concentrated areas
 - Certain places really important like attendance, pastoral notes

## Capacity 

 - Need for a lot of training to familiarise with the information
 - Leaders required in local areas to take it forward
 - Just having the data wouldn't solve all challenges

## Focus

 - Lack of data when families moves across authorities
 - Ideal system: parents and children can track their own progress
 - Two different systems - drill down more at a local level
 - Look at few children and focus
 - Needs of the families hidden
 - Portals for pupils to come in and see information presented in a way that's appropriate for them
 - 2 systems (+1) - One specific for the child, 2nd about influence

## Intention

 - What info to look at for certain goals
 - Clarity in purpose of gathering data is essential - not just collecting data for data's sake - clarity on vision of what aiming to achieve
 - Information needs to be outcome focussed
 - Need to add value with anything extra -not reinvent what already in existence

## Data

 - Challenging depending on the frequency of the different data sources
 - Very hard to standardise when data should be updated as they call come out at different times. Users would like more control
 - I feel that I do not get a lot of information form other sources suchas housing, justice, etc.
 - What function will depend the frequency of data

## Resistance

 - Would you actually use it?
 - Attainment advisor might not look at daily, weekly but focus school might be look at more regularly
 - You could end up creating a beast.
 - What info to look at for certain goals
 - People do not have time to go through complex processes
 - Need to know where to look to find data quickly

## Others

 - Danica part of an initiative that sources data from multiple sources and got access to a lot of data from multiagency initiative
 - Attainment advisor might not look at daily, weekly but focus school might be look at more regularly
 - Underlying reason for the pilot is early intervention. Each services is coming little bit in to picture but collectively it makes a lot of impact
 - Capacity issues and impact of Covid-19 -may impact on time available to drill down and deep dive into data available
