# Information Mapping
Layering numerous sources of information in an area around education (child, teacher, parents, etc.) toservices available (healthcare, financing, justice, etc.) to better track the factors affecting the education of a child.

## Overall
- A single system which ensures relevant data is available to schools and other stakeholders timely.
- Arguably the most important feature with focus on updating data on a regular basis.
- Similar system for all Local Authorities to deal with the inforkation in similar architechture and flow.

## Access
- Procuring the required data is a challenge and have to work with anecdotal information.
- Don't have suffiencient access to key data sources to make important decisions.
- Already have data sets in place and information sharing could be enabled with right tools.
- Information sharing agreements, legality of data transfer, particularly multi-agency is critical.

## Privacy 
- Security of huge amount of personal data related to pupils is important.
- Extremely sensitive data about children, families many are personal acquaintences in rural areas.

## Geography 
- Rural regions face the challenges of working with national data over local data.
- Small populations don't have enough data to understand the local context.
- Information based around population concentrated, affluent areas data areas doesn't match areas of depreievation.
- Geographic context are different across areas, certain places data like attendance, pastoral notes is very important.

## Capacity 
- Stakeholders need for a lot of training to familiarise with the information
- Leaders required in local areas to take it forward, just having the data wouldn't solve all challenges.

## Focus
- Lack of data when families moves across authorities, better understnad the hidden needs of families. 
- Look at few children and focus on the challenges faced by them individually.
- In an ideal system parents and children can track their own progress.
- Multiple systems, looking at the child and there sphere of influence.

## Intention
- Clarity in purpose of gathering data is essential, not just collecting data for data's sake.
- Information needs to be outcome focussed, what info to look at for certain goals.
- Need to add value to existing systems with extra inputs and not reinvent what already in existence.

## Data
- Do not get a lot of information form other sources suchas housing, justice, etc.
- Very hard to standardise when data should be updated as soon as it is available. 
- Challenging depending on the frequency of the different data sources.

## Resistance
- Which users would actually use a system like this?
- Attainment advisor might not look at daily, weekly but focus school might be look at more regularly.
- You could end up creating a beast, would need more clarity at what info to look at for certain goals.
- Need to know where to look to find data quickly, people do not have time to go through complex processes.

## Others
- Danica part of an initiative that sources data from multiple sources and got access to a lot of data from multiagency initiative.
- Underlying reason for the pilot is early intervention. Each services is coming little bit in to picture but collectively it makes a lot of impact.
- Capacity issues and impact of COVID-19, may affect the time available to drill down and deep dive into data available.
